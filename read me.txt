Howdy y'all!

Here we have a program that lets you do simple calculations like adding or subtracting.
The basic opearations used on our day-to-day basis. The calculator also includes scientific 
calculations such as:
exponents 
log
natural log (ln)
trig functions
memory

The calculator also includes the pythogoream theory and SOH-CAH-TOA. 


For developers pass this point.

The program is written in C++. It contains four functions defined prior to the main function. The main function calls the four defined functions which are: addition(), subtraction(), multiplication(), and division().
The addition() function/method takes in the user's input, adds the given numbers weather they're integer or double, and returns the value.
The subtraction() method does the same as previuos method expect it sudtracts the values, and same goes for the multiplication() and division(). The modulus (%) will be used to return a single digit number. 
If there's room for improvement,  tweaks to make it run better, or make look better for the end user let me know.
